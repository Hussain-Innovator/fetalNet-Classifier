This project presents an end-to-end deep learning solution for the classification of fetal ultrasound images. The goal is to accurately identify the anatomical plane shown in an ultrasound scan, which is a critical step in prenatal diagnosis.

### Key Objectives:
- To build a robust image classification model using modern deep learning techniques.
- To use transfer learning from a pre-trained model (`MobileNetV2`) to achieve high accuracy.
- To enhance the model with an attention mechanism (SE Block).
- To systematically evaluate the model's performance and understand the contribution of its components through ablation studies.
- To deploy the final model in an easy-to-use, interactive web application using Streamlit.

### Final Model Performance:
- **Architecture:** `FetalNet` (MobileNetV2 + SE Block + Custom Layers)
- **Best Test Accuracy:** **93.01%**
- **Best Macro F1 Score:** **0.91**

st.markdown("Our model classifies fetal ultrasound images into six anatomical planes using a MobileNetV2-based deep learning model enhanced with a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block. To ensure transparency, it integrates Explainable AI techniquesâ€”Grad-CAM, Saliency Map, Integrated Gradients, and Guided Backpropagation. The model is deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit for real-time predictions and visual explanations")
